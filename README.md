Rather than using dropbox, I kept all my school files in a git repo hosted on
github. It was a pretty awesome motivator to see graphs of my work as I was
doing it.

Now that I am done I want see my working as a retrospective.

## Questions to Answer

-When did I work?

-What words did I use in messages?
    - Did that change over time?

-What was the average word count of a commit message?
    - Did the time of day affect that?

- Did I commit more often during one year vs another?

- Who do I mention?

- What words do I misspell?
